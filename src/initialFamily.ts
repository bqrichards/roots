// Use this file to change the initial family that is loaded.
// The default export is the `Family` object to initialy load.

// Modifications to this file should be ignored by Git, so it's safe
// to define here or import a JSON file of a personal family tree.

// An example of loading a family from a JSON file would look like:
/*
import family from '../examples/families/basic.json'
export default family
*/

export default { name: 'Untitled', people: [] }
